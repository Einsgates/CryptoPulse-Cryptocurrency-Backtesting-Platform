##### Global default #####

## Any file not listed below will not have EOL characters normalized.
##   (Diffing and merging will depend on whether Git thinks the file is really
##   text or binary.)
*                       -text

## Alternatively, we could let Git auto-detect text files and normalize EOL,
##   by setting:
## *                       text=auto
